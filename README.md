# CP386-A04

CP386 Spring 2020 - Assignment 4 Code

## Motivation

Code here is for Assignment 4 for our CP386 Spring 2020 class at Wilfrid Laurier University

## Installation

To install, clone the repository locally and navigate to it from your terminal.
Then follow the instructions in the Makefile to compile; you can compile with the 2 commands:

```bash
make
```

which is the same as

```bash
make warnings_BAD
```

or you can compile with warnings allowed

```bash
make warnings_OK
```

---

You can delete before recompiling to ensure clean compiling by running:

```bash
make clean
```

---

Then to run the program, simply:

```bash
./Assignment_4 a b c...y z
```

Replacing the a,b,c parameters with any amount of integers to act as the available resources.
